<p>You can copy your image from this site to a remote server. You
will need to specify the remote server and account information as
described here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><b>FTP server name</b></dt>
<dd>The domain name of the web server you wish to upload to. Please
note that free homepage services generally use different domain
name for their FTP service other than the normal WWW server. For
instance, the one GeoCities uses for FTP is
<tt>ftp.geocities.com</tt>, not <tt>www.geocities.com</tt>.</dd><br />
<dd>If the target FTP server you are uploading to is using a
non-standard FTP port number (default is 21), you will need to
specify it explicitly. The way to do that is placing a colon
(<tt>:</tt>) after the FTP domain name, followed by the special
port number. For example: <tt>ftp.somewhere.com:1500</tt>.</dd><br />
<dt><b>Account Name</b></dt>
<dd>You need to specify your account name in the FTP server. On
some FTP servers like GeoCities, you need to specify your real
member account name. On other servers using anonymous account, you
just type <tt>anonymous</tt>. Please check their FTP upload
information page for sure.</dd><br />
<dt><b>Account password</b></dt>
<dd>Type in your password for the account name so that the system
can use the FTP to upload data for you. The typed-in password will
not be kept in any record for security reasons, and to protect both
you (the user of this service) and me (the owner of this service).
On servers using anonymous account, you can just type your username
and domain name. For example, <tt>jane@nowhere.org</tt>.</dd><br />
<dt><b>Upload directory</b></dt>
<dd>This is only for those servers which require you to type the
upload directory address, eg: <tt>/members/jane</tt>. For some
servers such as GeoCities this is not required because the actual
upload directory is automatically resolved by the account name, but
GeoCities is now capable of an exact address uploading, you'd
better still give it your address so that it can upload directly to
where you want much faster, for instance
<tt>/SiliconValley/Lab/1000</tt>.</dd><br />
<dt><b>Filename</b></dt>
<dd>You can specify a new name for the file to upload to your site.
Otherwise the file will be uploaded with its original name. Do not
specify any slash (<tt>/</tt>) or space in this
field.</dd><br /></dl></dd><br /></dl>
